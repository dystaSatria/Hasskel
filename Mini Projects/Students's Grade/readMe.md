# Question

You work as a developer for school A. The principal asks you to create a program in the Haskell programming language to make it easier for teachers to determine scores based on students' final grades.

For that, you have to generate code with the following criteria.

Create a variable named Studentvalue with independent values in the range 1-100.
Use a branching expression to print:
"A" if the value in the variable valueStudent is greater than or equal to 80.
"B" if the value of the Student value variable is greater than or equal to 60 and less than 80.
"C" if the value of the Student value variable is greater than or equal to 40 and less than 60.
"D" if the value of the Student value variable is greater or equal to 20 and less than 40.
"E" if the value of the Student value variable is other than that specified above.
